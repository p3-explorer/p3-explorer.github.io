description = """
The vlp4d application solves the Vlasov-Poisson equations in 4D (2D space and 2D velocity space). 
It is based on the 5D plasma turbulence code, GYSELA, but is miniaturised specifically for performance portability studies.

In this report, we have collected data running the two-dimensional Landau damping problem (SLD10), documented by Crouseilles et al. 
We have collected results on the Isambard system, making use of all available architectures (including the Phase 3 system).
