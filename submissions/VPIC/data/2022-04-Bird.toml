description = """
As we approach exascale computing the variety of architectures continues to expand. 
This makes porting and optimization very difficult. 
Using a portability framework like Kokkos alleviates these issues but the tradeoffs introduced have not been quantified. 
This project aims to explore the tradeoffs and optimization strategies involved when working with portability frameworks.
