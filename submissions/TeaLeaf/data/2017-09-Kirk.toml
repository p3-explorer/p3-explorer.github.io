description = """
In this paper, we investigate different implementations of TeaLeaf, a mini-application from the Mantevo suite that solves the linear heat conduction equation. 
TeaLeaf has been ported to use many parallel programming models, including OpenMP, CUDA and MPI among others. 
It has also been re-engineered to use the OPS embedded DSL and template libraries Kokkos and RAJA. 
We use these different implementations to assess the performance portability of each technique on modern multi-core systems.

The results in this paper have been collected from 3 different, single node, multi-core/many-core systems. 
Each of these systems have been configured with the same set of compilers (which are described in the paper), Linux kernel (3.16.0-4-amd64) and operating system (Debian GNU/Linux 8), in order to get comparable results.
